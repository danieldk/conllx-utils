# CoNLL-X Utilities

## Introduction

This is a set of utilities to modify files in the CoNLL-X tabular files. The
focus of this package is interoperability with TCF (Text Corpus Format).
However, the majority of the utilities are also useful outside TCF. The
package contains the following programs:

* conll-cleanup: replace most Unicode punctuation characters by
                 by ASCII equivalents.
* conll-cycle: find dependency trees with (non-self) cycles.
* conll-expandmorph: expand morphology features in TÃ¼Ba-D/Z.
* conll-merge: merge CoNLL-X files.
* conll-partition: partition a CoNLL-X file in N files.
* conll-sample: take a random sample from a CoNLL-X file.

## Download

Downloads are available on the [release

## Usage

Executing a command gives usage information when `--help` is given
as an argument.

## Todo

A lot, including:

* Partitioning is currently interleaving. Also support chunked partitioning.
* Test with problematic inputs.
* Merge specific columns from two CoNLL files.
