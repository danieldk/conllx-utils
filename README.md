# CoNLL-X Utilities

## Introduction

This is a set of utilities to modify files in the CoNLL-X tabular files. The
focus of this package is interoperability with TCF (Text Corpus Format).
However, the majority of the utilities are also useful outside TCF. The
package contains the following programs:

* conllx-cleanup: replace most Unicode punctuation characters by
                  by ASCII equivalents.
* conllx-cycle: find dependency trees with (non-self) cycles.
* conllx-expandmorph: expand morphology features in TÃ¼Ba-D/Z.
* conllx-grep: print sentences that have a token matching a pattern.
* conllx-merge: merge CoNLL-X files.
* conllx-partition: partition a CoNLL-X file in N files.
* conllx-sample: take a random sample from a CoNLL-X file.
